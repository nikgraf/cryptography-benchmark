# Cryptography Benchmark

This repository contains a benchmark comparing the performance of cryptographic libraries in Javascript.

Currently testing `@noble` and `libsodium-wrappers`.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpn dev
```

Open the browser and run the benchmark.

ATTENTION: Having Chrome DevTools open or not has quite an impact on Libsodium performance!
